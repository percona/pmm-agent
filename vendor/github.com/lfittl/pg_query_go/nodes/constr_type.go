/* ----------
 * Definitions for constraints in CreateStmt
 *
 * Note that column defaults are treated as a type of constraint,
 * even though that's a bit odd semantically.
 *
 * For constraints that use expressions (CONSTR_CHECK, CONSTR_DEFAULT)
 * we may have the expression in either "raw" form (an untransformed
 * parse tree) or "cooked" form (the nodeToString representation of
 * an executable expression tree), depending on how this Constraint
 * node was created (by parsing, or by inheritance from an existing
 * relation).  We should never have both in the same node!
 *
 * FKCONSTR_ACTION_xxx values are stored into pg_constraint.confupdtype
 * and pg_constraint.confdeltype columns; FKCONSTR_MATCH_xxx values are
 * stored into pg_constraint.confmatchtype.  Changing the code values may
 * require an initdb!
 *
 * If skip_validation is true then we skip checking that the existing rows
 * in the table satisfy the constraint, and just install the catalog entries
 * for the constraint.  A new FK constraint is marked as valid iff
 * initially_valid is true.  (Usually skip_validation and initially_valid
 * are inverses, but we can set both true if the table is known empty.)
 *
 * Constraint attributes (DEFERRABLE etc) are initially represented as
 * separate Constraint nodes for simplicity of parsing.  parse_utilcmd.c makes
 * a pass through the constraints list to insert the info into the appropriate
 * Constraint node.
